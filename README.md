# Similarity measurement

We will implement  about the coding methods as well as the mathematical 
foundations of Euclidean distance, cosine similarity and Pearson correlation
as three algorithms for finding the similarity.

## Description

Always keep these concepts in the background of your mind when reviewing algorithms.

1- Computations are applied to vector representations of objects.

2- The similarity/distance is calculated each time between a single pair of vectors.

3- Regardless of the algorithm, the choice of feature has a major impact on the results.
