# Similarity measurement

We will implement  about the coding methods as well as the mathematical 
foundations of Euclidean distance, cosine similarity and Pearson correlation
as three algorithms for finding the similarity.

Always keep these concepts in the background of your mind when reviewing algorithms.

1- Computations are applied to vector representations of objects.

2- The similarity/distance is calculated each time between a single pair of vectors.

3- Regardless of the algorithm, the choice of feature has a major impact on the results.
